# CareNest: Bridging the Gap in Childcare

## Inspiration

In Calgary, the demand for quality child care is overwhelming. Many families are faced with the reality of having to find a reliable, safe day home for their little ones; something further compounded by long waiting lists and limited spots. This gap not only stressed parents but also limited their opportunities for work and personal growth. This is why we were inspired to start CareNest: to be the kind of platform that ensures families can find the trusted care they need for their children, wherever they are.
